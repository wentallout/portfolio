## What you're doing wrong

Most job seekers approach their search by submitting resumes to job boards. This method, though common, is often ineffective due to high competition.

## Effective Job Search Methods

### 1. Internal Applicants

Scenario: You're close to getting a job, but an internal candidate is considered.
Advantage: Internal applicants are known, their performance can be checked, and they have existing relationships within the company.
Reality: Internal candidates are often preferred due to lower risk.

### 2. Referrals

Why They Work: Hiring managers trust referrals from current employees, considering them "de-risked."
Fast-Tracked: Referrals are often prioritized and fast-tracked.
Tip: Find connections within your target company and get referred.

### 3. Recruiter-Sourced Candidates

Method: Recruiters use LinkedIn to find passive candidates who match job requirements.
Pre-Vetted: These candidates have profiles with relevant keywords and competencies.
Interview Likelihood: More likely to be interviewed, but no guarantee of getting the job over inbound applicants.

### 4. Inbound Job Applicants

Definition: Candidates who apply directly through job postings.
Challenges: High competition, limited time to catch recruiters' attention (about 5 seconds).
Tip: Ensure your resume is sharp and clearly highlights your fit for the role.

## Why Avoid Solely Relying on Job Applications

- High Competition: Job applications are the most competitive and least prioritized method.
- Low Odds: Less than 5% chance of getting a call for competitive jobs.

## Skip the Competition

- Focus on Networking: Build a strong network and seek employee referrals.
- Resume Tip: If applying traditionally, ensure your resume clearly shows why you're the best fit.

By focusing on internal opportunities, referrals, and optimizing your LinkedIn profile, you can increase your chances of getting hired quickly and effectively.
