## Data to Information

Avoid copying raw data into designs. Transform dense content into organized, digestible visuals like infographics.

## Hierarchy Importance

Maintain a balance between visual weight by using up to five clear hierarchies in your design.

## Visual Direction

Use colors and layouts to guide the user's eye logically through the design.

## Visual Balance

Achieve both symmetrical and asymmetrical balance within compositions for interest and engagement.

## Clarity of Intention

Be bold or subtle but avoid ambiguity in design choices to communicate effectively.

## Natural Design Elements

Draw inspiration from nature to create visually pleasing designs that resonate with users.

## Engagement through Interaction

Incorporate animations and interactions to keep users engaged with your design.

## Use the Whole Canvas

Make full use of the available space in web design for a complete feel.

## Attention to Details

Small details matter significantly in creating polished and refined layouts.

Be pixel-perfect.

## Grid Structure

Use grids for organization, structure, and consistent alignment in design. Grids give your design a "rhythm"

## VERY IMPORANT: Practice and Experiment

Spend time actively creating layouts rather than just learning through tutorials.

## STEAL MORE: Inspirational Borrowing

Learning from other designs can enhance your style, as long as you don't replicate them exactly.
