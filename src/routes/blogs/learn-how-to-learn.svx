Want to study smarter, not harder? Here are 10 easy-to-follow tips that will help:

## 1. Focus & Diffuse
Work with full focus.

Then take breaks and relax — your brain processes info in the background too.

## 2. Link What You Learn
Create connections between topics.

Review, repeat, and practice often.

## 3. Mix It Up
Don’t always study the same way.

Try different techniques and switch things up.

## 4. Space It Out
Don’t cram.

Spread your study sessions out over time.

## 5. Practice, Practice!
Repetition builds strong memory.

Just like muscles, your brain needs regular workouts.

## 6. Test Yourself
Quiz yourself often.

Testing helps you remember better than just rereading.

## 7. Use Visuals & Emotions
Add images or stories to what you learn.

Emotion and visuals help lock in memory.

## 8. Use the Pomodoro Method
Study 25 minutes, break 5 minutes.

Helps with focus and avoids burnout.

## 9. Start with the Hard Stuff
Do the hardest tasks first when your mind is fresh.

## 10. Learn in Different Ways
Watch videos, read books, join study groups.

Variety helps ideas stick better.
