## What is A/B Testing

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions of a web page, app feature, or other product elements to determine which one performs better. It's a process particularly relevant for optimizing user experience and engagement on websites or applications.


## Process

The process involves the following steps:

- Hypothesis Formulation: Starting with a hypothesis about how a change could improve a specific metric.
- Creating Variations: Two versions are created - the original (A) and a variant (B).
- Randomized Experimentation: The audience is randomly divided into two groups for each version.
- Data Collection: Data on user behavior is collected for both versions.
- Analysis: Results of both versions are compared to determine the better performer.
- Conclusion: Deciding on the winning version based on the analysis.
- Implementation: The winning version is implemented for all users.

## Benefit

A/B testing allows for data-driven decision-making and is effective in refining user interfaces and experiences, leading to higher user satisfaction and better performance of web projects.
