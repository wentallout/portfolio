## What is responsive?

Responsiveness means a site responds (adapts) when viewed on different devices, zoomed in or when a user changes settings like default text size.

## Why 320px wide and above?

320px wide emulates iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 5, Xperia Compact etc and is an accessibility requirement for all sites under WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.10 (level AA).

## How to best approach responsive styling

As a more general answer to your questions around when and how to add breakpoints:

- Do all html before anything. Make sure the right meaningful elements are chosen for the content
- Style the mobile design first. Shrink your viewport down, zoom and/or use device emulation view.
- For frontend mentor challenges â€” where the mobile static design that's provided is 375px wide â€” get everything looking right at that width first.
- Then shrink the viewport width to 320px wide and check there's still no horizontal (inline) overflow and everything works.

ðŸ’¡ A top tip is to prefer max-width over width for your components! Also try to avoid fixed units when using flex or grid layouts, opting for % or fr units instead.
Only once you are happy with the mobile view should you start to enlarge the viewport. Depending on design, and what layout changes are needed, add a breakpoint (min-width media query) at the point where there is room for the layout to change. Make sure you note down the media query essentials below!

## Tips

- Let mobile styles be your default (Data tables are probably the only exception to this!)
- Test your solutions on small screens, making sure everything works from 320px wide and larger
- Stop saying that responsiveness is something you need to "do" as if it's a step you build in at the end. As front end developers, we need to consider how our sites/components should adapt before we write a single line of code.
- Get into the habit of using zoom in browser AND changing your default text size
- Check your site on real devices whenever you can, rather than only relying on in-browser emulation
