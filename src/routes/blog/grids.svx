## types of Grids

### Column Grid

### Modular Grid

### Hierarchical Grid

Even tho it's possible to use both a column and modular grids to establish a clear visual hierarchy, the Hierarchical Grid is used for the sole purpose of establishing a very clear visual hierarchy.

### Baseline Grid

Great if you want to achieve consistency with type + poster with a lot of types


They create a vertical rhythym

### Alternative: Axial Grid

Unlike the previous grid systems, the axial grid is free from columns, modules and encourages more free and simple layout.

### Alternative: Diagonal Grid

### Alternative: Radial Grid
