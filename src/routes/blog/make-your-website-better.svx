Test your site on various devices and browsers to ensure it looks and functions well everywhere. Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test tool as a starting point.

## Consistent Branding

Keep your visual elements consistent. Use the same color scheme and font styles across all pages.

Content should be easy to read and visually appealing. Incorporate bullet points, headers, and images to break up text.

Ensure your CTAs are prominently placed and impossible to miss. 

For example, use contrasting colors for your CTA button that stand out against the page background.
