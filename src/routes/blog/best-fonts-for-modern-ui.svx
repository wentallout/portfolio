## Why Skeuomorphism Worked

Familiarity Breeds Comfort: When computers were still foreign to most, these familiar icons and metaphors eased the transition.


Users felt more at ease when they could 'drag and drop' a digital document into a 'file folder' just as they would in the physical world.

Cognitive Load Reduction: Skeuomorphism reduced the cognitive load on users. 

They didn't need to learn entirely new ways of interacting with a computer; instead, they could rely on their existing knowledge.

Aesthetically Pleasing: Skeuomorphic designs often looked visually appealing, enhancing the user experience. 

The attention to detail in replicating real-world textures, like leather or wood, added a sense of craftsmanship.

## Font list

- Manrope (mostly Medium or Bold)
- Aeonik (Aeonik is very versatile and highly legible, however, this comes at a cost as the licenses might be out of reach for certain organizations and designers.
)
- Satoshi (What I donâ€™t like about it is that you always need to have uneven spacing on top and bottom as it has a higher line height, which easily makes your elements visually not centered.)
- Work Sans (Work Sans is an ideal type choice for modern user interfaces because of its simplicity and readability, making it well-suited for both body text and headlines in digital environments. )

- Haskoy
- Aspekta
