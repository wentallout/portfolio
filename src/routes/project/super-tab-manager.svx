## The Problem

My Chrome browser was running like a potato with 50+ tabs open - Stack Overflow, documentation, and YouTube tutorials everywhere. Finding that one specific tab felt like searching for a needle in a haystack.

I figured if I'm struggling with this, others probably are too. So I built Super Tab Manager - think of it as Marie Kondo for your browser tabs, but automatic.

## Why Do We Keep So Many Tabs Open?

It's a common habit, and here's why:
- Research: Gathering information on a topic
- Fear of Forgetting: "I might need this later!"
- Multitasking: Handling multiple tasks simultaneously
- Comparison: Shopping, comparing products or solutions
- Procrastination: Saving things to read "later"

## The Real Cost of Tab Hoarding

This habit comes with serious drawbacks:
- Performance: Slows down your computer, drains battery
- Focus: Decreased productivity from constant tab switching
- Organization: Can't find important tabs when needed
- Stability: Risk of browser crashes and lost work
- Mental Load: Visual clutter leads to decision fatigue

## The Solution: Super Tab Manager

<Image src={whatitdoes}/>

Just 1 click, and watch as your messy tabs transform into organized groups. Each group represents a domain - for example, all your YouTube tabs nest together in one tidy cluster called `youtube.com`.

More features added:

- 📦 Groups similar tabs by domain
- 🔎 Powerful tab search
- 🗑️ Removes duplicates
- 🚫 Closes distracting social media tabs
- 📊 Tracks memory usage
