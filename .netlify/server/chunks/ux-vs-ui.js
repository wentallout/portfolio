<p>UX Design always puts users needs first when considering design solutions in order to enhance customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>UX is short for “User Experience” and is the overall experience of a user using a product or interacting with a website. The focus is on making a good user experience, where interacting with a website is pleasing and easy. A good design, clear content, fast load times and nice interactions with appropriate animations are all part of a good user experience. In common usage, “the UX” of a site or app often refers to the design and interaction combined.</p>
<ul><li>Defining a problem</li>
<li>Understanding users</li>
<li>Creating personas</li>
<li>Generating tasks &amp; user flows</li>
<li>Creating sketches -&gt; wireframes -&gt; prototypes</li>
<li>Usability testing</li></ul>

<p>UI Designers make products joyful to interact with. They focus on the visual hierarchy and patterns that give visual cues to users.</p>
<ul><li>Typography</li>
<li>Color scheme</li>
<li>Iconography</li>
<li>Grids, Layout, Spacing</li>
<li>Buttons, Inputs &amp; Forms</li></ul>

<p>View everything that you do as <strong>PROBLEM SOLVING</strong> -&gt; Organize, Economize and Communicate.</p>
<p>Design should serve <strong>USER NEEDS</strong>. Why are they here - and what do they need to do?</p>
<p>Hierarchy is communicated <strong>VISUALLY</strong>. Visual priority = user priority.</p>
<p>Information hierarchy is mainly created by <strong>CONTRAST</strong>. Always consider contrast before color.</p>
<p>When in doubt, <strong>ALIGN EVERYTHING</strong>. Alignment creates order, flow and stability.</p>
<p>Purposefully design all <strong>NEGATIVE SPACE</strong>. Give it more attention than UI elements.</p>
<p>Primary elements should come <strong>FORWARD</strong>. Secondary elements should <strong>RECEDE</strong>. You should work to visually differentiate the two.</p>
<p>Maximize <strong>SIGNAL</strong>. Minimize <strong>NOISE</strong>. Keep visual focus on what matters most.</p>
<p>=&gt; Remember that you’re solving <strong>VISUAL PROBLEMS</strong>. Focus on that; great UX will take care of itself.</p>`;
