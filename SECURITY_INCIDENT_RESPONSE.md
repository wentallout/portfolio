## 🛡️ **RESPONSE PROCEDURES**

### **Phase 1: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (0-1 hour)**

#### **1.1 Assess the Situation**
```bash
# Check security dashboard
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     "https://your-domain.com/api/security/dashboard"

# Review recent security events
# Check application logs
# Verify system status
```

#### **1.2 Contain the Threat**
```bash
# For API key exposure:
1. Immediately revoke exposed keys
2. Generate new keys
3. Update environment variables
4. Restart services

# For DDoS attack:
1. Enable Cloudflare DDoS protection
2. Implement emergency rate limiting
3. Block malicious IP ranges

# For data breach:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Document everything
```

#### **1.3 Emergency Actions**
```javascript
// Emergency service shutdown (if needed)
export async function GET() {
  return new Response('Service temporarily unavailable for maintenance', { 
    status: 503,
    headers: { 'Retry-After': '3600' }
  });
}
```

### **Phase 2: INVESTIGATION (1-4 hours)**

#### **2.1 Evidence Collection**
```bash
# Collect logs
netlify logs --site=your-site-id

# Export security events
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     "https://your-domain.com/api/security/dashboard?hours=24" > incident-logs.json

# Document timeline
# Screenshot evidence
# Preserve system state
```

#### **2.2 Impact Assessment**
- [ ] Determine scope of compromise
- [ ] Identify affected data/systems
- [ ] Assess business impact
- [ ] Estimate recovery time

#### **2.3 Root Cause Analysis**
- [ ] Analyze attack vectors
- [ ] Review security controls
- [ ] Identify vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document findings

### **Phase 3: CONTAINMENT & ERADICATION (4-24 hours)**

#### **3.1 Implement Fixes**
```bash
# Update security configurations
# Patch vulnerabilities
# Strengthen access controls
# Update dependencies
```

#### **3.2 Security Hardening**
```javascript
// Example: Enhanced rate limiting
const EMERGENCY_RATE_LIMITS = {
  'default': { max: 10, window: 60000 },
  'api/*': { max: 5, window: 60000 },
  'contact': { max: 1, window: 300000 }
};
```

#### **3.3 Monitoring Enhancement**
- [ ] Increase logging verbosity
- [ ] Add additional alerts
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated responses

### **Phase 4: RECOVERY (24-72 hours)**

#### **4.1 Service Restoration**
```bash
# Gradual service restoration
# Monitor for recurring issues
# Validate security controls
# Performance testing
```

#### **4.2 Communication**
```markdown
# Security Incident Notice Template

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL PROCEDURES**

### **Emergency Security Measures**

#### **1. Immediate IP Blocking**
```javascript
// Add to security middleware
const BLOCKED_IPS = new Set([
  '192.168.1.100', // Example malicious IP
  '10.0.0.50'      // Another example
]);

function isBlockedIP(ip) {
  return BLOCKED_IPS.has(ip);
}
```

#### **2. Emergency Rate Limiting**
```javascript
// Implement strict rate limiting
const EMERGENCY_LIMITS = {
  window: 60000,    // 1 minute
  max: 5,           // 5 requests max
  blockDuration: 3600000 // 1 hour block
};
```

#### **3. Service Degradation**
```javascript
// Graceful service degradation
export async function GET({ request }) {
  if (isUnderAttack()) {
    return new Response('Service temporarily limited', {
      status: 503,
      headers: {
        'Retry-After': '300',
        'X-Rate-Limit-Reason': 'Security incident response'
      }
    });
  }
  // Normal processing
}
```

### **Recovery Procedures**

#### **1. System Validation**
```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
node comprehensive-security-test.js

curl -I https://your-domain.com/rss.xml

# Check security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com/ | grep -E "(CSP|X-Frame|X-Content)"
```

#### **2. Performance Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor response times
# Check error rates
